## Tell me about yourself + GitHub {.smaller}

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. You may want to use this to show-off work to future employers so I recommend using something professional (like your name) as your user name.

Send me a Teams Chat with answers to the following questions:

1. What is the GitHub username you just created?
2. What would you like me to call you?
3. Why are you taking this class?
4. What are your career goals?
5. Is there anything else you would like me to know about you? E.g. athlete, preferred pronouns, accommodations, etc...
6. Please recommend at least one and up to infinity songs for the class playlist.

# MATH 4025

## Course FAQ

**Q - What background is assumed for the course?**

A - Familiarity with concepts from statistical inference, linear regression, and logistic regression. Some experience with Python or R, especially when it come to manipulating and visualizing data.

## Course FAQ

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**

A - Yes. We will mostly be using Jupyter notebooks for analysis, but may use Quarto for presentations and project. We will use GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Course FAQ

**Q - Will we learn the mathematical theory?**

A - Yes and No. The course is primarily focused on application; however, we will discuss some of the mathematics occasionally.

## Course FAQ

**Q - What distinguishes this from a 3000-level course?**

A - I expect a high level of independence from you. You should not be relying on me to teach you every small detail from this course. For example, if I tell you about a Python function, I expect that you will be able to figure out how to use it yourself.

## Course FAQ

**Q - Is there anything else I should know?**

A - Machine learning is a RAPIDLY evolving field. If you want to be successful in this field going forward, you will need to be able to learn things for yourself and SELF-ASSESS whether you know them. There are portions of this course that I have *intentionally* designed to not give you enough information to solve on your own.


## Course learning objectives {.midi}

By the end of the semester, you will be able to...

-   tackle predictive modeling problems arising from real data.

-   use Python to fit and evaluate machine learning models.

-   assess whether a proposed model is appropriate and describe its limitations.

-   use Jupyter notebooks and Quarto to write reproducible reports and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

-   effectively communicate results through writing and oral presentations.

## Academic integrity {.smaller}

> The College of Idaho maintains that academic honesty and integrity are essential values in the educational process. Operating under an Honor Code philosophy, the College expects conduct rooted in honesty, integrity, and understanding, allowing members of a diverse student body to live together and interact and learn from one another in ways that protect both personal freedom and community standards. Violations of academic honesty are addressed primarily by the instructor and may be referred to the [Student Judicial Board](https://collegeofidaho.smartcatalogiq.com/en/current/Undergraduate-Catalog/Policies-and-Procedures/Academic-Misconduct).

By participating in this course, you are agreeing that all your work and conduct will be in accordance with the College of Idaho Honor Code.

## Collaboration & sharing code

-   [I have policies!](/course-info/syllabus.qmd)

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}

## Use of artificial intelligence (AI) {.midi}

-   **Allowed and Encouraged!**
    -   Use AI tools to supplement your learning.

-   **Your Responsibility:**
    -   You are responsible for everything you submit.
    -   **MUST** be able to explain every line of code.
    -   **MUST** be able to explain all results.

::: callout-important
If you cannot explain your code or results when asked, it will be treated as if you did not do the work yourself.

## In class agreements

If we discuss/agree to something in class or office hours which requires action from me (e.g. “you may turn in your homework late due to a sporting event”), you MUST send me a follow-up message. If you don’t, I will almost certainly forget, and our agreement will be considered null and void.

# Having a successful semester in MATH 4025

## Five tips for success

1.  Complete all the preparation work (readings and videos) before class.

2.  Ask questions, come to office hours and help session.

3.  Do the homework; get started on homework early when possible.

4.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.

5.  Stay up-to-date on announcements on Canvas and sent via email.

## Emails for help

If you email me about an error please include a screenshot of the error and the code causing the error.
