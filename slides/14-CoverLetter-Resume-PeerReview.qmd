## Peer Review {.smaller}

You will be placed in groups of two or three:

-   Spend about 10-15 minutes reviewing each of our partner's documents
    +   Point out anything that is unclear
    +   Point out any typos or grammatical errors. If there are A LOT, then just say "PROOF READ"
    +   Fill out the rubric you have
    +   Pretend to be an employer: Write down a few questions you have and would want to learn more about based on the documents you have.

-   After your group is done reviewing, discuss each persons document as a group.
    +   Talk about strengths
    +   Talk about weaknesses
    +   BE KIND AND SUPPORTIVE!
    
-   If you're getting feedback, take it graciously!
