The group set is called **HW7**. Your group will consist of 2-3 people and has been randomly generated. The GitHub assignment can be found [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/DkTfH-Nj). Rules:\n\n1.  You are all responsible for understanding the work that your team turns in.\n2.  All team members must make roughly equal contributions to the homework.\n3.  Any work completed by a team member must be committed and pushed to GitHub by that person.\n\n# Dataset: Communities and Crime\n\nFor this homework, we'll return to the Communities and Crime data set from the UCI Machine Learning repository. From the abstract:\n\n> \"Communities in the US. Data combines socio-economic data from the '90 Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 Law Enforcement Management and Admin Stats survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR.\"\n\nMore details can be found [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime+unnormalized). Our goal will be to predict the number of crimes per capita, stored in the column called `ViolentCrimesPerPop`.\n\n## Cleaning and Preprocessing\n\n## Exercise 1\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nLoad the data set `CommViolPredUnnormalizedDataCleaned.csv` and clean it. Hint: review Exercises 1-4 of your previous homework.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nSplit the data into a training and test set using an 80-20 split. Use the seed 427.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 3\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nGenerate a recipe that can be used with a regression tree.\n:::\n\n# Baseline Model\n\nBefore we start building fancy models, it's helpful to understand our data and to have a simple baseline for comparison.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nWhat was the best model from your last homework? Write out the model below in a neat format. What was it's RMSE and $R^2$?\n:::\n\nIdeally we'd like any model we create to make better predictions that this baseline model. Hopefully, we can do better than this model using a regression tree.\n\n## Exercise 5\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nBefore you fit any trees, do you think a decision tree will have better performance than the baseline model? Describe the differences between linear models and decision trees including the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n:::\n\n# Regression Trees\n\n## Exercise 6\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nFind a good Regression Tree to model the data. Use a grid search and cross-validation to find a good complexity parameter.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 7\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nFit your tree on the entire training set and use the `rpart` functions from class to display it.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 8\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nBased on your tree, which variable do you think is most important for determining the number of Violent Crimes Per Capita?.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 9\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nHow many different predictions are possible from your regression tree model? Why? How does this compare with the baseline model you selected in Exercise 4.\n:::\n\n# Final Evaluation\n\n## Exercise 9\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nCompute the root mean squared error for your regression tree model applied to the test set.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 10\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nHow does the test error compare to the baseline model? Which model has better performance? Compare the interpretability of each model.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 11\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nLook at the documentation for `decision_tree` by typing `?decision_tree` in your console. Notice that there are two other tuning parameters, `tree_depth` (defaults to 30) and `min_n` (defaults to 2). Use an [irregular grid](https://www.tmwr.org/grid-search#irregular-grids) with at least 100 points and cross-validation to find an optimal combination of your three tuning parameters. Why do you think we want to use an irregular grid, rather than a regular grid here?\n:::\n\n## Exercise 12\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nFit the resulting model to the full training data and estimate it's performance on the test set.\n:::\n\n## Exercise 13 (Practice interview question)\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Question\"}\nDescribe how `tree_depth` and `min_n` should impact the flexibility and bias-variance trade off of the resulting tree.\n:::\n",
