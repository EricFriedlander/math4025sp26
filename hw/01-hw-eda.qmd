title: "Homework 1: Exploratory Data Analysis"
---

Adapted from "Start teaching with R," created by R Pruim, N J Horton, and D Kaplan, 2013, "Interactive and Dynamic Graphics for Data Analysis," by Dianne Cook and Deborah F. Swayne, Colby Long's DATA 325 Course at Wooster College and Maria Tackett's STA-210 course at Duke University.

## Introduction

In this homework we will familiarize ourselves with the tools that we'll use throughout the course and refresh ourselves on topic related to exploratory data analysis.

## Course Toolkit

The primary tools we'll be using in this course are **Python**, **Positron**, **git**, and **GitHub**. We will be using them throughout the course both to learn the concepts discussed in the course and to analyze real data and come to informed conclusions.

::: callout-note
**Python** is the programming language. **Positron** is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) where we write code. **Miniforge/Conda** manages our Python installations and packages.
:::

::: callout-note
**Git** is a version control system (like "Track Changes" but for code) and **GitHub** is the cloud hosting service for your Git projects.
:::

To make versioning simpler, this homework will be completed individually. In the future, you'll learn about collaborating on GitHub.

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Environment

Before we analyze data, we need to set up our computer. This process involves installing a package manager (Miniforge), creating a virtual environment, and installing the necessary libraries.

### 1. Install Miniforge
We will use **Miniforge** to manage our Python installation. It pre-configures `conda` (package manager) and `mamba` (a faster version of conda) with the `conda-forge` channel, which is the community standard.

1.  Go to the [Miniforge GitHub page](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
2.  Download the **Miniforge3** installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3.  Run the installer and follow the prompts.
    *   *Windows*: Open "Miniforge Prompt" after installation to verify.
    *   *Mac/Linux*: Open your terminal.

### 2. Create a Conda Environment
We never want to install packages into our "base" environment. Instead, we create a specific environment for this course.

Open your terminal (or Miniforge Prompt) and run:

```bash
mamba create -n math4025 python=3.14
```
*   `mamba create`: Command to create an environment.
*   `-n math4025`: Names the environment "math4025".
*   `python=3.14`: Specifies the Python version.

### 3. Activate the Environment
To use the environment, you must activate it:

```bash
mamba activate math4025
```
You should see `(math4025)` appear in your prompt.

### 4. Install Packages
Now we install the tools we need for this assignment.

```bash
mamba install pandas seaborn matplotlib plotnine itables jupyter polars pyreadr
```
*   `pandas`, `polars`: Data manipulation.
*   `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotnine`: Data visualization.
*   `itables`: Interactive tables.
*   `jupyter`: Required to run Notebooks.
*   `pyreadr`: For reading R datasets.

## Part 2: Setting up Positron & Git

### 1. Install Positron
We will use **Positron**, a new data science IDE from Posit (makers of RStudio).

1.  Download and install [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/install.html).
2.  Open Positron.
3.  Select your Python Interpreter:
    *   Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    *   Type `Python: Select Interpreter`.
    *   Choose the `math4025` environment you just created.

### 2. Configure Git & GitHub
You need a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** to allow Positron to talk to GitHub securely.

1.  Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.
3.  **Generate new token (classic)**.
4.  Name it "Math4025", select the **`repo`** scope, and generate.
5.  **Copy the token immediately!**
6.  Configure Git on your machine (run in terminal):
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Github Username"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
7.  When asked for a password during cloning/pushing, paste your **PAT**.

## Part 3: The Assignment

Now you will create your own Jupyter Notebook to analyze tipping data.

### 1. Clone the Repository
1.  Go to the course [GitHub assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/lqxGMOZJ).
2.  Copy the HTTPS URL.
3.  In Positron: `Control Palette` > `Git: Clone` > Paste URL.

### 2. Create Your Notebook
1.  In Positron, create a new file named `hw01-analysis.ipynb` inside your repository folder.
2.  Add a Markdown cell at the top with a title "Homework 1: Exploratory Data Analysis" and your name.

### 3. Load the Data
In your first code cell, import your libraries and load the `tips` dataset from Seaborn.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from plotnine import *
from itables import show

tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
```

### 4. Committing changes

Now, go to the Source Control extension in the left-hand panel.

If you have made changes to your files, you should see it listed here. Clicking on these files shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.

If you're happy with these changes, we'll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, stage your changes by clicking the `+` button next to the file you want to stage. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, "update author name") in the Commit message box. Finally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.

You don't have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration.

In the first few assignments I will nudge you when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.

Now let's make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you're good to go!

### 5. Push changes

Now that you have made an update and committed this change, it's time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.

In order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged your commit to be pushed. 

### 4. Understand Your Data
Use `tips.head()`, `tips.info()`, or `tips.describe()` to explore the dataset.

*   **Question 1**: How many rows (tips) are in the dataset?
*   **Question 2**: Which days of the week is the restaurant open?

### 5. Numerical Summaries
Using `groupby`, calculate summary statistics.

*   **Question 3**: What is the median tip amount for "Lunch" vs "Dinner"? (Hint: `tips.groupby('time')['tip'].median()`)
*   **Question 4**: Create a new column `tip_pct` (tip / total_bill * 100). Calculate the variance of `tip_pct` by day of the week.

### 6. Graphical Summaries
Create the following plots using the library of your choice (`seaborn` or `plotnine`).

*   **Plot 1**: A bar chart of `sex`.
*   **Plot 2**: A histogram of `total_bill`.
*   **Plot 3**: A scatterplot of `total_bill` vs `tip`, colored by `smoker`.

### 7. Exploration
**final Task**: State a conjecture about tipping behavior (e.g., "People tip more on weekends"). Create **one plot** and **one summary table** to investigate your claim. Write a short sentence interpreting your findings.

## Submission
1.  Save your notebook.
2.  In the Source Control tab (Git icon), **Stage** your changes.
3.  **Commit** with a message like "Finished HW01".
4.  **Push** to GitHub.
