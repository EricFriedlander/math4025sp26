    "text": "Course community\n\nCollege of Idaho Honor Code\n\nThe College of Idaho maintains that academic honesty and integrity are essential values in the educational process. Operating under an Honor Code philosophy, the College expects conduct rooted in honesty, integrity, and understanding, allowing members of a diverse student body to live together and interact and learn from one another in ways that protect both personal freedom and community standards. Violations of academic honesty are addressed primarily by the instructor and may be referred to the Student Judicial Board.\n\nBy participating in this course, you are agreeing that all your work and conduct will be in accordance with the College of Idaho Honor Code.\n\n\nDisability Accommodation Statement\nThe College of Idaho seeks to provide an educational environment that is accessible to the needs of students with disabilities. The College provides reasonable services to enrolled students who have a documented permanent or temporary physical, psychological, learning, intellectual, or sensory disability that qualifies the student for accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act or section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. If you have, or think you may have, a disability that impacts your performance as a student in this class, you are encouraged to arrange support services and/or accommodations through the Department of Accessibility and Learning Excellence located in McCain 201B and available via email at accessibility@collegeofidaho.edu. Reasonable academic accommodations may be provided to students who submit appropriate and current documentation of their disability. Accommodations can be arranged only through this process and are not retroactively applied. More information can be found on the DALE webpage (https://www.collegeofidaho.edu/accessibility).\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website, EricFriedlander.github.io/math4025sp26.\nPeriodic announcements will be sent via email and will also be available through Canvas and grades will be stored in the Canvas gradebook. Please check your email regularly to ensure you have the latest announcements for the course.\nWe will be using Microsoft Teams for communication. Please make sure you have access to the class team.\n\n\nIn class agreements\nIf we discuss/agree to something in class or office hours which requires action from me (e.g. “you may turn in your homework late due to a sporting event”), you MUST send me a follow-up message. If you don’t, I will almost certainly forget, and our agreement will be considered null and void.\n\n\nGetting help in the course\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nI am here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours and the homework lab to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. You are encouraged to use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments can be emailed to me.\n\n\n\nEmail\nIf you have questions about assignment extensions or accommodations, please email efriedlander@collegeofidaho.edu. Please see Late work policy for more information. If you email me about an error please include a screenshot of the error and the code causing the error. Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to course emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.",

There will be a short quiz at the beginning of class every Tuesday to ensure you are keeping up with the material.\n\n\nHomework\nHomework will be graded on a pass/fail basis and will be assessed via presentation. Assignments will be due at the beginning of class on Thursday. Students will be randomly chosen to present their solutions. Each solution will be followed by a discussion by the class on what did and didn’t go well.\n\nHonesty Policy: If you did not complete the homework and are honest about it, you will receive 50%. If you demonstrate no understanding of the homework during presentation, you will receive a 0%.\n\n\n\nJob Application & Job Interview\nDuring this course you will apply to one “job”. I will generate the job advertisement including a real company and base the job description on the course content and similar job advertisements. The job application will have three components:\n\nA cover letter.\nA resume.\nA portfolio.\n\nAll three of these should be tailored to the job description and the company to which you are applying. Your portfolio will consist of self-contained data analyses of your choosing. To create your portfolio, you will be required to create a website.\nAfter you submit your job application, you will be invited to schedule a one-hour long job interview. It is your job to schedule your job interview with Dr. Friedlander. The interview will include general interview questions, questions about your portfolio, and a “case interview” portion.\n\n\nMidterm Exam\nThere will be one midterm exam to assess your understanding of the core concepts covered in the first half of the course.\n\n\nHack-a-thon\nAt some point in the semester we will participate in a “Hack-a-thon” as a class. Namely, you will be given a short period of time (1-3 days) to build a model and make a set of predictions. After the competition is over, you will be required to present on your model. Part of your score will be determine by how well your model performs and extra credit will be given to the top scoring individuals.\n\n\nProject\nDuring the latter portion of the course, you will complete a final project that involves a deep exploration of a problem. More details for the final project will be provided later in the course.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nThe job application assignments must be completed individually but you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share (i.e. via copy/paste or copying) any code or prose with anyone other than myself.\nFor the hack-a-thon, everyone will submit their predictions and give their own presentations. However, you are encouraged to work together. You are allowed to share code with one another. However, everyone should be able to explain what they did and everyone’s projects should be unique in some way. Point reductions will be given if two individuals submit the exact same predictions.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You are allowed and even encouraged to use AI tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.) to supplement your learning. However, strict adherence to the following is required:\n\nYou are responsible for all work that you submit.\nYou must be able to explain what every line of code does and explain all results that you submit.\nIf you cannot explain your code or results when asked, you will receive a grade of 0 for that assignment.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, just ask.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all College of Idaho policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Honor Code.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nLate Homework: Homework is pass/fail based. Assignments are due Thursday morning. If you do not complete the assignment but are honest about it, you will receive 50%. If you demonstrate no understanding during the presentation, you will receive 0%.\nQuizzes & Presentations: Late quizzes and presentations will not be accepted without an excused absence.\nSchool-Sponsored Events/Illness: If an assignment or meeting must be missed due to a school-sponsored event, you must let me know at least a week ahead of time so that we can schedule a time for you to make up the work before you leave. If an assignment or meeting must be missed due to illness, you must let me know as soon as it is safe for you to do so and before the assignment or meeting if possible. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in a 35% penalty on the corresponding assignment.",

For example, you might work for an online retailer and want to develop a model to predict which purchased items will be returned. Or, you may not have a particular question in mind. Instead, you might just be asked to look at browsing data for several customers and figure out some way to increase purchases. In either case, before you construct a fancy model, you need to explore and understand your data. This is how you gain new insights and determine if an idea is worth pursuing."

    "section": "Understand Your Data",
    "text": "Understand Your Data\nToday we will be working with the TIPS data set which is in the regclass R package. I’ve saved the data as a csv and included it in the repo for this assignment. The data in the TIPS dataset is information recorded by one waiter about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in a restaurant. We would like to use this data to address the question, “What factors affect tipping behavior?”\nIn python you can import packages in a few ways:\n\nimport pandas will import pandas. Every time you want to use pandas you’ll have to prepend pandas. (e.g. pandas.read_csv())\nimport pandas as pd will import pandas and allow you to use the shorthand pd (e.g. pd.read_csv())\nfrom pandas import * will import everything from pandas (e.g. read_csv())\nfrom pandas import read_csv() will import only read_csv() (e.g. read_csv() will work but no other pandas functions will work)\n\nCommon conventions in data science:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nExercise 1\nIn your Jupyter notebook, create a code cell at the top and load pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot.\n\n\nCommitting changes\nNow, go to the Source Control extension in the left-hand panel.\nIf you have made changes to your files, you should see it listed here. Clicking on these files shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\nIf you’re happy with these changes, we’ll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, stage your changes by clicking the + button next to the file you want to stage. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, “update author name”) in the Commit message box. Finally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\nIn the first few assignments I will nudge you when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\nNow let’s make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you’re good to go!\n\n\nPush changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub. There are a few ways to do this, if you’re new to Git raise your hand or ask someone near you.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged your commit to be pushed.\n\nUsing the Command Line\nEventually you’ll be better off using git from the terminal or command line:\n\ngit add files-you-want-to-stage or git add . to stage all files that have changed\ngit commit -m \"This is your commit message\"\ngit push to push your changes\ngit pull to pull changes from your remote repo\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nWhen exploring a new data set, it’s important to first understand the basics. What format is our data in? What types of information are included in the data set? How many observations are there?\nIn the Python ecosystem, data sets are usually stored in a 2-dimensional structure called a DataFrame. The pandas library has long been the industry standard for data manipulation. After importing these libraries, you can get an idea of the structure of a data set using df.info(), and you can peek at the first few rows with df.head(). If you’re used to using R, one thing you’ll notice that all of these data manipulations are methods rather than functions. Create a code chunk and use these functions (and others) to better understand the data. Use tips.head(), tips.info(), or tips.describe() to explore the dataset. How many tips are recorded in this data set?\n\n\nExercise 3\nOften, a data set will come with a code book which gives more complete information about the structure of the data, the meaning of variables, and how the data were collected. In this case, most of the column names are pretty self explanatory.\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nTipPercentage\nthe gratuity, as a percentage of the bill\n\n\nBill\nthe cost of the meal in US dollars\n\n\nTip\nthe tip in US dollars\n\n\nGender\ngender of the bill payer\n\n\nSmoker\nwhether the party included smokers\n\n\nWeekday\nday of the week\n\n\nTime\ntime the bill was paid\n\n\nPartySize\nsize of the party\n\n\n\nEven though the column names are self-explanatory, we might have more questions about the data. For example, we might conjecture that people tip differently for breakfast and lunch, but our data only tells us if the bill was paid at “Day” or “Night.” State another reasonable conjecture about a factor that might affect tipping behavior. What additional information would be helpful to explore that conjecture?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRender-Commit-Push\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to render, commit, and push changes to your GitHub repo. Write an informative commit message (e.g. “Complete exercises 1 - 3”), and push every file to GitHub."

They also help you communicate insights about your data to others. For example, we might want to display relationships about some of our categorical variables. So we could start by graphing different party sizes in our data set.\nThere are a few different packages for generating plots in Python:\n\nmatplotlib: The foundational “grandfather” of Python plotting, offering granular low-level control for creating static, publication-quality figures, though often requiring verbose code.\nseaborn: A high-level wrapper built on matplotlib that simplifies statistical visualization (like heatmaps and regression plots) with beautiful default themes and fewer lines of code.\nplotnine: A strict implementation of the “Grammar of Graphics” (mimicking R’s ggplot2), designed for users who prefer building plots by logically layering data, aesthetics, and geometries.\nplotly: The best choice for interactive and web-ready charts, allowing users to zoom, pan, and hover over data points, making it ideal for dashboards."

Note that you’ll have to wrap your plots in parenthesis because Python can’t follow the line breaks in the same way as R. In addition, if you want to create multiple plots in the same cell, you have two options. One option is to convert your plotnine plots into matplotlib objects using the .draw() method to convert a plotnine object into a matplotlib figure or ._draw_using_figure(fig, [ax]) to assign the plotnine object to an existing axis within a matplotlib figure. The second is to use brick from the package patchworklib which allows you to arrange figures.\n\n# --- Plot 1: Boxplot ---\n(\n    ggplot(tips, aes(x='Weekday', y='Tip'))\n    + geom_boxplot()\n    + labs(title=\"Tips by Day of the Week\", x=\"Day of the Week\", y=\"Tips\")\n)\n\n# --- Plot 2: Boxplot + Jitter ---\n(\n    ggplot(tips, aes(x='Weekday', y='Tip'))\n    + geom_boxplot(outlier_shape=None) # Hide outliers so they aren't plotted twice\n    + geom_jitter(width=0.2)\n    + labs(title=\"Tips by Day of the Week\", x=\"Day of the Week\", y=\"Tips\")\n)\n\n# --- Plot 3: Violin ---\n(\n    ggplot(tips, aes(x='Weekday', y='Tip'))\n    + geom_violin()\n    + labs(title=\"Tips by Day of the Week\", x=\"Day of the Week\", y=\"Tips\")\n)\n\n# --- Plot 4: Sina ---\n(\n    ggplot(tips, aes(x='Weekday', y='Tip'))\n    + geom_sina()\n    + labs(title=\"Tips by Day of the Week\", x=\"Day of the Week\", y=\"Tips\")\n)\n\nfinal Task: State a conjecture about tipping behavior (e.g., “People tip more on weekends”). Create one plot and one summary table to investigate your claim. Write a short sentence interpreting your findings."
