    "text": "Assignments\nYou will be assessed based on five components: homework, job applications, job interviews, a hack-a-thon, and project.\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture to complete data analysis tasks. Homework will completed in teams of three, must be typed up using Quarto, and submitted as .qmd and .pdf files in via GitHub.\n\n\nJob Applications & Job Interviews\nDuring this course you will apply to two “jobs”. I will generate the job advertisements including real companies and base the job description on the course content and similar job advertisements that I get from online or professional collaborators. Each job application will have three components:\n\nA cover letter.\nA resume.\nA portfolio.\n\nAll three of these should be tailored to the job description and the company to which you are applying. Your portfolio will consist of self-contained data analyses of your choosing. The most straight forward method of creating th to repurpose your homeworks, converting them from a format in which you are responding to exercises to something where you are telling a narrative and demonstrating that you meet the job criteria. To create your portfolio, you will be required to create a website. More details on this will be given during the semester, however the idea of this project is that you will be able to use the things you general when you are applying for jobs.\nAfter you submit your job applications, you will be invited to schedule a one-hour long job interview. It is your job to schedule your job interview with Dr. Friedlander. Each job interview will have three portions. The first, lasting 10-15 minutes, will include typical questions that apply to almost any job interview (e.g. “What are your biggest strengths and weaknesses”). The second, lasting 20-30 minutes, will include questions about the portfolio you submitted and your understanding of the required skills described in the job advertising. The third section will mimic what is called a “case interview”. Case interviews are extremely common for many jobs, especially those requiring quantitative or computational skills, and can be intimidating. During the case interview portion, you will be presented with a “case study” and asked questions on how you would go about approaching it. The cases themselves will be designed so that they can be solved using the content from class. The goal of this whole exercise is to assess your knowledge of the course content in a way that is authentic while also preparing you to get a job.\n\n\nHack-a-thon\nAt some point in the semester we will participate in a “Hack-a-thon” as a class. Namely, you will be given a short period of time (1-3 days) to build a model and make a set of predictions. After the competition is over, you will be required to present on your model. Part of your score will be determine by how well your model performs and extra credit will be given to the top scoring individuals.\n\n\nProject\nDuring the latter portion of the course, you will complete a final project that involves a deep exploration of a problem. More details for the final project will be provided later in the course.",

    "section": "Course policies",
    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\n\nThe job application assignments must be completed individually but you are welcome to discuss the assignment with classmates (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share (i.e. via copy/paste or copying) any code or prose with anyone other than myself.\nFor the hack-a-thon, everyone will submit their predictions and give their own presentations. However, you are encouraged to work together. You are allowed to share code with one another. However, everyone should be able to explain what they did and everyone’s projects should be unique in some way. Point reductions will be given if two individuals submit the exact same predictions.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\nUse of artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat AI tools, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity. In general if the following two things are not true, you are cheating:\n\nYou understand and can explain all of the code you have written down or you don’t and you have cited the source of that code.\nAll of your prose and narrative were written by yourself.\n\n\nIf you are unsure if the use of a particular resource complies with the academic honesty policy, just ask.\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all College of Idaho policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more). Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Honor Code.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. I understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline.\n\nLate Homework: Homework is completion based and well be accepted without penalty for a week. However, if your homework is turned in after I begin grading it, you will not receive any feedback.\nSchool-Sponsored Events/Illness: If an assignment or meeting must be missed due to a school-sponsored event, you must let me know at least a week ahead of time so that we can schedule a time for you to make up the work before you leave. If an assignment or meeting must be missed due to illness, you must let me know as soon as it is safe for you to do so and before the assignment or meeting if possible. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in a 35% penalty on the corresponding assignment.",
